Computer Graphics Final Project:

I started working on the 3D model of the simple cube shape.

I have implemented basic cube with the plane.

Recently, i implemented simple cube rotating in the plane.

I also provided the user to dynamically select the object and rotate in all directions.

I have started working on the object selection and view interface. I am facing some erros in the project so that's why 
i don't have much to present in this week submission.

In the next update, i am planning to implement the all view of the shape and then after UI interface and scaling.

I will also provide the ability to select the object, color and size of the object.
