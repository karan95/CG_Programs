Computer Graphics Final Project:

I started working on the 3D model of the rectangle and cylinder shape.

I have just implemented basic 3D rectangle and cylinder.

In the next step, i am planning to implement the all view of the shape and then after UI interface and scaling.

Currenly i don't have much to display in Project but in the next submission, i will implement most part.
