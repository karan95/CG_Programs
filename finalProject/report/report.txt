Computer Graphics Final Project:

I started working on the 3D model of the simple cube shape.

I have implemented basic cube with the plane.

Recently, i implemented simple cube rotating in the plane.

In my current update, i have provided the user to dynamically select the object and rotate in all directions.

In the next step, i am planning to implement the all view of the shape and then after UI interface and scaling.

I will also provide the ability to select the object, color and size of the object.
